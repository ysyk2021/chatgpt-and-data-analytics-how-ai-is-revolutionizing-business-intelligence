Chatbots and AI are increasingly being used in data analytics and business intelligence to provide faster and more accurate insights through natural language processing. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of chatbots and AI in data analytics and business intelligence.

What are Chatbots?
------------------

Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users. They use natural language processing algorithms to understand and respond to user queries, providing real-time answers and recommendations.

In data analytics and business intelligence, chatbots can be used to provide insights on data trends, generate reports based on user queries, and identify anomalies in data.

How Does AI fit into Chatbots?
